# Phonero Website
# You Could check this out in: https://ilyesboukraa.github.io/Phonero_website.io/
it was a project I built during my second year
of my Bachelor's Degree In Information Systems
and Software Engineering.
It is a front-end project 
I used only HTML and CSS
even the animations in the phonnes section 
are not implemented with JavaScript
but in CSS only, to gain Performance! 
I just want to build a Website
and enjoy learning Typography
Color Theory, CSS/HTML and so much more

Thank You!
