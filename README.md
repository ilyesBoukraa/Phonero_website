# Phonero Website
# You Could check this out in: https://ilyesboukraa.github.io/Phonero_website.io/
###  it was a project during my second year
### of my Bachelor's Degree In Information Systems
### and Software Engineering.
### It is a front-end project 
### I used only HTML and CSS
### even the animations in the phonnes section 
### are not implemented with JavaScript
### but in CSS only, to gain Performance! 
### the idea of the website was definetly stupid
### but I just want to build one
### and enjoy learning Typography
### Color Theory and so much more
# Thank You!
